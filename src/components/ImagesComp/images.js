    text: `We have waited for this European Action Plan for a long time. Indeed, this is not only a
    question of geographical solidarity, but also of intergeneration solidarity. By investing
    massively in water pipes and distribution systems, as well as in scientific research, you
    will increase access to fresh water across Europe. In addition, you will also save water
    in the long run, by finding other ways to get fresh water for future generations.
    Progress made in desalination is a good example. It will become easier in the future to
    remove the salt out of seawater, to use it for our environment and as drinking water.`

    text: `I have been unemployed for two years now. I used to work in a bottle factory but it was
    shut down and moved outside Europe. They said that the price of tap water was so
    low that bottled water could not compete – because of the price of the plastic bottles,
    you see.
    I don’t know if this is true, but what I know is that I have been looking for a job since
    then... without success.`

    text: `Dear Membre of the Euorpean Parliament, I write you because I have heard that a
    massive action plan “to save water” is undre preparation at the Euorpean level. Please
    let me tell you that I have seen a lot of ambitious plans in my life and they have all
    falied but one: the Marshall plan after the War.
    Sp I beg you to remain reasonnabme, not to spend too much money on this, and to
    focus on keeping stabliity in our society.
    I hope you will read this letter to the end and follow the advice of an old man.`
